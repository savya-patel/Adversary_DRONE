⚠️ IMPORTANT - DO NOT USE THIS LAUNCH FILE ⚠️

This launch file starts slam_toolbox which has known issues on ROS 2 Humble:
- TF message filter deadlock (drops ALL scans)
- "queue is full" errors
- Incompatible with high-frequency LiDAR (20 Hz)

✅ USE CARTOGRAPHER INSTEAD:
  cd ~/Adversary_DRONE/slam_ws
  ./run_cartographer.sh          # Standard launch
  ./run_cartographer_log.sh      # With logging

If you accidentally started this file and slam_toolbox is running:
  cd ~/Adversary_DRONE/slam_ws
  ./kill_all_slam.sh             # Kill everything
  ./run_cartographer.sh          # Start Cartographer
